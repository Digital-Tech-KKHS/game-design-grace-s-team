# {Owl escape}

# Elevator pitch
 I am developing an open world RPG game that is set in the mediaeval time with aspects of real time. The gameplay is story driven and is centered around an owl, and its journey to redeem itself and learn quality of life without everything being handed to you.
 
# Concept Overview
The beginning concept of the game was for there to be an owl that has its ability to fly taken away from it by some magical force, and so it ventures to get its "wings" back, its ability to fly. Along the way it will face challenges and obstacles that it must face and avoid to continue onwards. The way the levels will work is that it is up to the player which way they go but eventually all the levels will lead back to either the beginning level or the end level.

### Genre: Open-world RPG / Action:
the genre is a type of good vs evil and journey type experience that is highly based on man vs nature and man vs self. It will have aspects of action and journey.

### Target audience:

> Age: 15-30
> (Teens)
> Gender: Male/Female
> People that are interested in animal games, or fantasy and adventure
> People that want a game with cute graphics and characters

# Theme and setting

The theme of the game is that it is an adventure type RPG and you travel across the lands to reclaim something that you once took for granted. The setting of the game is natural with ocean and forests.  It also has sections of desserts and Tundra's. I wanted to make it so that throughout the nature there are hints of man made items that don't look like they belong or like they are trashed there and the owl has to avoid them because it can get caught in it and die. I wanted the theme to be not only be adventure but also mystery in a way so that the player can search unknown territories and find new things.

# Project scope
The project will be a game that I will design and make art for.

## Our team
I am on a team by myself but will listen to what my classmates and teacher have to offer and what advice I can get from them


# Timeline
The project should take around 2 terms and will start from week 5 term 1 to week 9 term 3 
The timeline for my game is from around medieval time. The game relies heavily on the art and story so I have to make sure that I allow enough time for those aspects to be to be completed to the best of my ability and to a quality that I am happy with

# Game Setting

The game is set in the mediaeval time and is based somewhere in the British isles, it would be an island that is secluded and alone and isn't accessible easily. it is set in a normal summer day and has many trees and natural items, as well as desserts and man made items that don't seem to belong there.

## The Isolated Isle 
General description:

The isolated isle is a place of isolation. It is a place of loneliness and perhaps sadness. It has buzzing bugs that chase you and dare you to get close only for them to kill you. The trees sway in the breeze that comes in from the ocean and they watch as a lonely owl makes its way through them. It has pits and bits of metal that would hurt a flightless owl. Animals call to each other from afar and observe all that goes on, waiting for a meal to wander by. Feathers are littered all about as if picked up by the wind and tossed at random, the owner of the feathers is out of place in such an area, it should be high in the tree tops away from random cliffs and pits that lead to a deadly ocean and burning fires. The land seems to be almost poisoned itself because of how grass meets sand, in a fight to win similar to the inhabitants of such a place that have to fight to be remembered.

Inspiration:

Irish grass field terrain, natural forests, cracked desserts

# Story
An owl (Main character) must wander across different terrains to collect all of its feathers back that it has lost. It has lost the ability to fly and believes that it needs to collect these feathers to fly again. But little does it know the journey was not intended to be easy and  it was intended so that the owl would learn to not judge people so easy  and it would take the small things for granted, and learn to struggle without something that it would normally rely on. It's wings. Because what is a bird if it cannot fly? And is it perhaps not trying to escape only from the dangers of the land but also from the toxicity in its heart?

## Backstory 
...
A brown speckled barn owl was flying around one crisp blue day, when suddenly a tree appeared out of no where. The tree was large and knocked the bird out almost instantly. When it was awoken it saw the face of a grey owl staring down at it. Shocked the bird got up and scurried away from the grey owl noticing its gross rugged, musty stinking appearance. The grey owl asked if the brown owl was alright after such a collision, and the brown owl replied with
"Yes of course why wouldn't I be?" The other owl was shocked by the hostility in the brown owls voice and went to walk towards the rude owl. 
"what do you think you are doing?" It exclaimed again trying to retreat from the revolting owl that looked as if its wings hadn't kissed the clouds in years.
"Why must you be so rude fledgling? I was only enquiring after your health." The grey owl asked "It looked as if you might have needed assistance."
"No!" The brown owl shouted "I am in need of no assistance from you old owl, you disgust me. Your feathers are matted and dirty and your wings are so small and shriveled, I wouldn't want to catch a disease from you, lest you ruin my beautiful feathers with your disgust!"
The old grey owl was heartbroken from the horrible words of the younger owl and decided that this owl needed to be brought back down to earth from its high perch and learn to fight for its wings that it oh so loved very much.
"Fine, if you do not wish to accept my concern for you, you will instead accept my wrath." The older owl said calmly. "Because you love your feathers and wings so much I will have to take them from you, so that you can learn how to have some gratitude for those things that are always there to carry you across the great sea in the sky. And because of how rude you were to a lowly owl like me, I  am condemning  you to this place where you will learn what I have had to endure so that before you judge my appearance, you understand what having no flight to rely on can make you become."
The brown owl shrieked as it tried to fly away and realized that its ability to fly was gone. It tried again and again but it could not catch wind under its wings. It crawled across the floor to the grey owl and asked it what it must do to regain its ability to fly......

# Gameplay

## Movement
How is your player going to move? Do they respond to gravity? How is the user controlling them?
...
-The character will not have gravity other then when it jumps so that it can return to its original position. It will move vertically and horizontally across the terrain. This movement will be determined by the player as they will move the character with WASD keys. They can also activate the jumping function with the space bar. 

## Objects
What things exist in your world? Are there collectables, keys, spikes or moveable blocks?
...
-In my world I have interactable tiles such as: 
- Walls, stops the character from moving in certain directions when you collide with them
- Danger, makes the character lose health and eventually die
- Ground, something for the character to walk on so that it can move and function as it needs too 
- Foreground, a tile that makes it so that the character can appear behind something else and give depth to the game
- Text, will make writing appear that the player can read and further understand the objective and what needs to be done
- Next_level, allows the player too "continue" the game and be set to a different level
- Winner, sets the game to a win view that shows the ending of the game
- Speed_boost("......"), sets the characters speed to a higher amount for a certain period of time
- Feathers, coins that the player can collect and use to increase there score and complete the game
- Trees, grass, shrubs, grass, bushes, adds depth to the game and usually wont be interactable except acting as a wall
- Enemy, something that will track the player and can make them die 
- Signs, notes, help guide the player as to what's ahead and what to expect

## Actions
What does your player do? Do they interact with anything? If so, what and how?
...
My player will run around and interact with coins and damaging items. It will also need to be able to avoid enemies (mosquitos). The player can make the  character jump and run with the WASD keys. the character will also be able to interact with certain items that make speech appear

## Combat  
Are there enemies in your game? How do they move? How do they hurt the player? How does the player overcome them? Do they respond to the player or simply act in a predefined way?
...
I have enemies that are stationary in the sense that they are solid items that when the character does to them they will get damaged. I also have moving enemies that actually follow the character no matter what and damage it to the point of death. The enemies are coded to track the player and I can adjust their speeds to increase or decrease the difficulty.

## Talking
Do your characters communicate? Is it through audio or text? What key plot elements are represented through dialogue?
...
The only talking that happens during my game is when my character interacts with an object or an npc and that is the thing that talks, and gives advice or hints.

## UI elements
How does the player know what is going on in the game? What key aspects of the state of the game need to be communicated to the player? Is there a menu or an inventory? Is there a tutorial? How will the player know how to interact with your game? 
...
The player will have to go to the npc and read what it says. They will also be able to pick up hints about how to play the game from the signs that I put around the maps.

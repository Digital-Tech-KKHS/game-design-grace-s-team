# {Title}

# Elevator pitch
 I am developing an open world RPG game that is set in the medievel time with aspects of real time. The gameplay is story driven and is centered around an owl.
 
# Concept Overview
The beginning concept of the game was for there to be an owl that has its ability to fly taken away from it by humans, and so it ventures to get its "wings" back. Along the way it will face challenges and obstacles that it must face and avoid to continue onwards. The way the levels will work is that it is up to the player which way they go but eventually all the levels will lead back to either the beginning level or the end level.

### Genre: Open-world RPG / Action:
the genre is a type of good vs evil and journey type experience that is highly based on humans vs nature. It will have aspects of action and journey.

### Target audience:

> Age: 15-30
> (Teens)
> Gender: Male/Female
> People that are interested in animal games, or fantasy and adventure
> People that want a game with cute graphics and characters

# Theme and setting

The theme of the game is that it is an adventure type RPG and you are the good guy and you travel across the lands. The setting of the game is light and natural with ocean and forests.  It also has sections of desserts and Tundra's. I wanted to make it so that throughout the nature there are hints of man made items that don't look like they belong or like they are trashed there and the owl has to avoid them because it can get caught in it and die. I wanted the theme to be not only be adventure but also mystery in a way so that the player can search unknown territories and find new things.

# Project scope
The project will be a game that I will design and make art for.

## Our team
I am on a team by myself but will listen to what my classmates and teacher have to offer and what advice I can get from them


# Timeline
The project should take around 2 terms and will start from week 5 term 1 to week 9 term 3 
The timeline for my game is from around medieval time. The game relies heavily on the art and story so I have to make sure that I allow enough time for those aspects to be to be completed to the best of my ability and to a quality that I am happy with

# Game Setting

The game is set in the medievel time and is based somewhere in the British isles, it would be an island that is secluded and alone and isnt accesible easily. it is a set in a normal summer day and has many trees and natural items.

## The Isolated Isle 
General description:

The isolated isle is a place of isolation. It is a place of 
the trees sway and scream there agony as they get pulled and pushed around by the wind. The occasional thud and slither of a creature can be heard as it moves around and hunts for its next victim. 
A screech above way in the tree tops show that there are all manner of wildlife bustling around and are awaiting for there next meal to scrurry out of its hideaway and be caught in the talons of such beasts

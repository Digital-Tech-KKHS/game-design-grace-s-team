# Elevator pitch
 I am developing an open world RPG game that is set in the medievel time with aspects of norse mythology. The gameplay is strongly story-driven

We're developing an open-world RPG game set in a medieval fantasy world inspired by European folklore. Its gameplay is strongly story-driven and based on the best-selling book "Earl of the Rings". It's "The Witcher" meets "Dark Souls" meets "Game of Thrones".
 
# Concept Overview
beginning idea was to have a "good guy" that is typically known as a bad guy. this good bad guy would be going on a mission fighting 

### Genre: Open-world RPG / Action:
the genre is a type of good vs evil and journey type experience that is highly based on fantasy and norse mythology

### Target audience:

> Age: 15-30
> (Teens)
> Gender: Male/Female
> People that are interested in fantasy creative games
> People that want a game that is beautiful and carries a deep meaning 

# Theme and setting

The theme of the game is that it is a hystorical type rpg and YOU are the "bad guy" where you go across different lands and get new powers as you go. The character underoges different challenges that need to be completed in sections and sepecific orders, where they fight "enemies" which are vikings and they travel to get there baby back that the vikings stole. As your character travels across the land it encounters different objects that can botth help and make the journey harder. The point of the game is to show the loyalty that the mother kelpie has for its baby and the lengths that it will go to get it back.

# Project scope

The timeline for my game is from around A.D. 800 to the 11th century, and from medieval time. The game is also heavily fantasy based and so

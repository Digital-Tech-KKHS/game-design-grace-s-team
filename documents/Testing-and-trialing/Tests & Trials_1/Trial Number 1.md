## Trial goal:
>The goal for this trial was to determine whether or not  I would do my game in isometric or in 2D I got multiple peoples ideas and I asked them which style they preferred. I hoped that everyone would collectively agree on a style and they all did. They preferred the 3D isometric style game then the 2D flat game.

## Results
> - I changed the angle of my tiles
> - Sylvie didn't like the colour of my tiles so I said that I would change it at a later day to a more pleasing colour
> - All candidates collectively agreed that the isometric design was more pleasing then the 2D design
> - Gabby said that I should change the style of the tiles to a more complex style with more pixels per tile
> - My teacher Mr. Ward liked the isometric style of the game, and gave me feed back on how I should be designing my art to fit with the isometric design
> - I had to make my game go from a 2D game to a 3D game and so I saw that I would have to change my code and how my character moved and interacted with the ground

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I had to make my game go from a 2D game to a 3D game and so I saw that I would have to change my code and how my character moved and interacted with the ground
> - I changed the original story of my game to accommodate with the extra work load of the game being 3D
> - I changed the art and how the tiles were orientated within the Tiled map
> - I changed the resolution of my tiles and made them more detailed
> - I disenabled gravity so that I would be able to walk around freely so that I would be able to determine how I wanted the character to interact

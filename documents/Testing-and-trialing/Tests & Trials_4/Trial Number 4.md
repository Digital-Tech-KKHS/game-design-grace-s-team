Involved in the trial
>- Gabby Smythe
>- Sylvie McDonald

## Trial goal:
>The goal for this trail was to determine whether or not I would have my enemies set in a fixed pattern of moving either from side to side, or top to bottom, or be free moving and be able to follow the player.

## Describe the trail
> I loaded up my game and asked people of my class about which style they preferred. I showed them the free moving enemies by loading my first map and moving my character around so that they followed it. I then explained how if they would have a set path either horizontal or vertical they wouldn't be able to follow a player around and would only act if the player came into contact with them.

Enemies set on a specific path ^
## Results
> - Everyone was able to see a clear difference between the two types of enemies patterns
> - Gabby preferred the free moving enemy because it added a goofy sense to the game and it made the enemy seem more "alive"
> - Some people were unsure about what the enemy would look like and if I would be able to make it seem like it was "hunting" the owl
> - about 70% liked the idea of a predator chasing the owl, where as some liked the idea of a human chasing it
> - Mr. Ward liked the idea of the "seeking" characteristic
> - There was a bug found when the free moving enemy would try to make its way to the player and it would have a "vibrate" type effect.

## Breifly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I added a character place holder which was a snake so that you could see what the enemy could potentially end up looking like
> - I implemented the free moving enemy 
> - I made sure that the "enemies" seemed like enemies so that the end users would know to try and run away from them 
> - Increased the speed of the enemy after a potential end user said that the enemy was perhaps to slow and wasn't "scary" enough
> - I changed how the enemy seeked so that it was the free moving one

Involved in the trial
>- Gabby Smythe
>- Sylvie McDonald

## Trial goal:
>The goal for this trail was to determine whether or not I would have my enemies set in a fixed pattern of moving either from side to side, or top to bottom, or be free moving and be able to follow the player.

## Describe the trail
> I loaded up my game and asked people of my class about which style they preferred. I showed them the free moving enemies by loading my first map and moving my character around so that they followed it. I then explained how if they would have a set path either horizontal or vertical they wouldn't be able to follow a player

OBLIQUE^
## Results
> - There was some confusion as to what the difference between oblique and 2D was 
> - about 50% liked the oblique over the isometric design 
> - Everyone understood that oblique would be easier and more practical to do in code and art
> - They liked the idea of very earthy and natural themes that would help my story
> - My teacher agreed that oblique would be easier to use to code my game in instead of isometric
> - People thought that the character movement looked better in oblique

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I  made a lot of oblique art 
> - I made a walking animation that suited my character walking in this perspective
> - Didn't change any of the colours
> - I changed my new idea about how my character would interact with the edge of water
> - I asked people if they thought that my end user would be able to understand what type of angles I was going for
> - Decided to add a jumping function

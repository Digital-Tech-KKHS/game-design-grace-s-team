Involved in the trial
>- Gabby Smythe
>- Sylvie McDonald
>- (Others from around the class)

## Trial goal:
>The goal of this trial was to determine whether I would use trees as a block for stopping my character from walking off the edge or if I would use just a normal water block.

## Describe the trail
>I got people from my class to decide what one they preferred more  and which one they believed would be more practical for my end users to understand and use.

## Results
> - Almost every single person that I showed these two examples too agreed that the one with the trees was more pleasant to look at 
> - Sylvie was unsure how I was going to make the trees a boundary but I explained how I would set the half of the tree that hangs over the water to my wall layer in my Tilemap
> - I had some reservations on the tree design but my teacher agreed that it is important to not get stuck on the fine details of it when it looks fine to begin with
> - Everyone thought that the colour of the trees suited the environment
> - There was concerns on how I was gunna make my character seem like they were in front of the trees while also having them stop against them

## Briefly describe the changes you have made based on this trial
> - I changed my original idea of spending heaps of time on the trees and I would instead see if I had time later on in term to see if I could give them more detail  
> - I have changed my second level to have these trees be the boarder instead of the plain water one
> - Fixed how the character interacted with the trees after a few issues with the boundaries
> - I added a feature that made it look like it the character was standing in front of the tree for a bit when
> - Changed character movement so that it would be easier for my end users to use
> - Added more variety of trees

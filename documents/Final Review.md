Review your initial game design document. Compare and contrast the game you had initially planned and your final outcome. 
... 
At the beginning of the year when I first started making my game I was very set on what I wanted to get done and what features my game would end up having, however like most things I ended up completely changing my game and story line with new art ideas and all. I wanted the original story to be based on a kelpie from Celtic mythology that was the protagonist and have humans be the antagonists. However I quickly came to the idea of my main character being an owl instead because I believed that it was a more achievable and realistic goal. Although I changed the idea the concept basically stayed the same with the functions I wanted to enable and all together I am happy with what I have been able to make in the time.  Even with the new Idea I had many different things that I had to consider such as wat perspective it was going to be, or what was the colour theme going to look like, or would the art all match together. I also wanted to challenge myself with the coding sides of things and force myself to learn new things so that meant that I added things like enemies that flew instead of walked like I had originally planed in my initial game design document.

Given each of the initial success criteria that you determined when designing your project, was your game a success? Why or why not? 
...
I think the one of the biggest helps throughout the whole project was asking my peers what they thought of my game, whether the art was good or whether different functions made sense. I was constantly asking people so that my end users would be able to enjoy the game as much as I wanted them too and I believe that I succeeded in that. I made my game easy to understand. Easy to control. interesting without being confusing. And fun without being obnoxious. Perhaps I could have added different features that made the game more difficult but then maybe my end users would have been put off it and would have not understood how to complete the game. So overall I believe that it ticked the boxes.

Describe the testing process you undertook to ensure your game functioned as intended. 
...
As I said above I tested many times with other people and there opinions, but I also tested the actual fundamentals of the game such as how the character would operate or how colliding with a certain tile would make the character jump away and lose damage or make them teleport to a completely different map. I also went online and tested a lot of code on Python Arcade to see what I could add to my own to improve it.

Describe your trialing process, and the impact that it had on the development of your outcome.

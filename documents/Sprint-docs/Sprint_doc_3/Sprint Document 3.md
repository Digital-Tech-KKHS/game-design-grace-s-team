# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I tested going to different levels and I tested how trees would be used to block my character from going to specific places. and I also had a lot of trouble making my trees work to be the walls, so I had help from my class mates and I also experimented with different ways to deal with the issue in tiled. The main issue with my trees that I was having was a issue where when my character collided at a certain point with the trees my game would close and an error message would appear. The issue itself turned out to be an issue in tiled like I predicted and so I had to work my way around that to solve it. I also wanted to work on damage and I successfully made it so that I my owl character would get damaged when it came into contact with a "coil of barbed wire", and would "jump" backwards away from the wire. I also added more art and made another entire level that used the trees as a way for the character to be blocked in. Jumping was a big thing that I wanted to implement into my game so that my character would have another element to it that would make it fun and more enjoyable for the players to use. I first had problems with the gravity function, with it wanting to revert gravity to 0 and so my player would drop, and then I had issues with my character jumping too high and it not reverting back to its original position. In the end I was able to get my player to jump around WITH a shadow that would shrink when the player was "air born" and would expand when my player came back to the ground.

## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No team-mates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
 - I changed my map and some of my art, and also was able to get a jumping function working to an extent.
## **Brief Description of your testing**
- I tested how my character would jump and land, I tested how it would get damaged against my barbed wire. I also tested how I wanted my character to jump backwards once damaged

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
- In the next sprint I really want to add some kind of text element in it so that it feels more interactable with the player and also so the end user can know to stay clear of certain things.
- I also would like to make enemies next sprint as well. I have wanted to make them for a long time because I believe that they will improve my game a lot and bring more challenge and enjoyment to it
- I also need to split my code up so that it isn't in one large file where it can get hard to find what I'm looking for

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.  

“With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces," said Megan Cook, Group Product Manager for Jira Software at Atlassian.

In this class we are going to use them to help you manage your own individual project.

Our sprints are three weeks long. This is 12 blocks of class time and should include at least two hours of work at home.

We will be working on our project for about 16 weeks. So each sprint is an eighth of the total project. Some time in class will be taken managing the sprint.

Here is the overview.

# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I tested my game a lot on potential end users and class mates. I asked Gabby, Erin, Sylvie, and Zane to test my game and give me feedback. I learnt that both Gabby and Zane had issues doing a jump so I used this to make my jumps easier to jump across so that the game was more enjoyable. I wondered if it would be better to increase the speed of my character or shorten the jump. After testing the increasing speed idea I ended up going with making the jump shorter because I saw that if I increased the speed of the character it threw of the speed of it naturally and didn't look and feel as good to use. I also asked them what they thought of the art and they liked it however Erin said that she wanted me to add more small details so that it would feel more complete. I fixed my characters walking animation which ended up being a piece of code that I had somewhere else that was making the code contradict itself. I made my final map which I had to make new tiles for and I made "wings" at the end of the map that lead the player to an end view which shows the game was over. I also made a collision tile that if you didn't have enough feathers it would say that you need to go look for more. I went through all the levels multiple times with my character to make sure that there was no gaps in the tiles or any tiles that didn't belong there. I made completely new win, death, and start screen art as well which turned out better then I could have hoped. I redid my game design document because it still was about my old idea kelpie idea for my game, and I touched up my sprint docs, tests, and trials across all the sprints to make sure that I hadn't missed anything. I added an NPC which enabled me to have dialogue and bring more of the plot into and story into the game, as well as helping the end user understand what they needed to do. The NPC says to the player that they must get at least a certain amount of feathers to win, by feathers they mean coins because I changed all of my "bug coins" into feathers to fit better with the story. I ended up deciding that I would add a "bonus" feather somewhere on my map that would +5 onto your score when you collide with it, and I increased the the minimum amount of feathers required to get to the "win" screen because of this. I also asked my teacher to open my game on his computer so that I could see if it worked on a different computer but also I wanted the opinions of someone who hadn't played my game much. The current enemies that I had I feel didn't really add anything to the story and I wanted something kind of silly yet also practical so I swapped out my snake design for a mosquito. Overall in this sprint I did a lot of things, the reason being that it was the final one, and also I kept coming up with ideas that I wanted to add that I believed the end users would enjoy more. Another thing that I added was music. I made my own music in Sound Trap and I put it into my game to play in the background while the end users moved around and played my game.
## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No team-mates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
Major changes were the different win, lose, and start views that I made. Before they were blank PNG's that had writing on them and after they were full of the story and colour which I believe really helped the game pop.
Also changing the enemy to a mosquito was a good change because there was a glitch that got created from the tracking engine of the enemies that would make it appear that the snakes were vibrating, and so with them being mosquitos they suited this because it made them look as if they were buzzing. And I honestly believe that it made them look better then just slowly floating towards the player.
Music was something that I knew needed to be added but I just never had the time to spare to actually make it and then put it into my code. I am glad that I got around to doing it because it made everything feel more final? like my game wasn't just a concept anymore but an actual game that had its own music instead of empty silence

# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I basically just wanted to get a solid Mvp, I also made sure that my code can work and I would decide how I wanted my game to be orientated I made a whole bunch or very basic art that I would use as a place holder so that I could get my code working and I changed my character to be a very basic design that I wasn't sure I would keep but it was just a place holder. I also did a lot of work on my game design document (which I ended up completely redoing later because my whole game and story changed).
## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No team mates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
-there were a few specific changes that I had to change, including my character for my MVP and my tilesets, I also changed my original idea from a kelpie to a an owl that the ability to fly and so must journey to go get its wings back "metaphorically". The reason that I decided to go with the the owl was because the owl made more sense when it came to actually coding the game and getting its legistics done. however changing the whole concept of my game meant that the art that I had started making had to be redone into an owl so that took me a while to re-think how I was going to do my project.
## **Brief Description of your testing**
- I tested how my tilemap would load up into my gameview, I tested how my backgrounds would load up in  my start view, and it tested to see if it was a good enough solution so that my final stakeholders would be able to use it easy and understand how it works.

"Game wasn't functional at this point..."

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
- Next time I want to make sure that I work on my tilesets more, and how my character will functions for my story
- I want to improve how I record information in my sprint docs

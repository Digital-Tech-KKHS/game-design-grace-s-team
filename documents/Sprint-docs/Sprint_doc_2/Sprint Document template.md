# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I did massive amounts of testing and trialing. Over the holidays I did most of the art that I origanially that I would use, and I tested how my character would move on my isometric map. I also changed my code in a way so that when I pressed the "D" button it would move my character in a diagonal way that is parallel to the sides of the gorund. I also ran into a lot of issues trying to make my character able to "hit" walls or collide with them and then stop moving all together. By the end of the entire sprint I decided that I would make my game be oblique

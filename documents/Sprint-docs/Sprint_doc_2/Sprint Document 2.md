# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I did massive amounts of testing and trialing. Over the holidays I did most of the art that I origanially that I would use, and I tested how my character would move on my isometric map. I also changed my code in a way so that when I pressed the "D" button it would move my character in a diagonal way that is parallel to the sides of the gorund. I also ran into a lot of issues trying to make my character able to "hit" walls or collide with them and then stop moving all together. By the end of the entire sprint I decided that I would make my game be oblique instead of isometric so that it would make my game easier to manage
## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No teamates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
I changed my game from isometric to oblique and I therefore had to change all of my art that I had previously done. I achieved getting my walls working and I also made my art compatible with the rest of my code.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
- I want to make sure that I make sure to test more parts of my game so that it becomes a fully functioning game that my end users can use and test
- I also want to improve how my character moves and add more art to my game so that it feels like it is more finished

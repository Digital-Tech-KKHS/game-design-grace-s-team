# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I got a lot of code work done. I got speech pop ups to work so that when my character came into contact with a skull and bones, a speech message, "This looks dangerous...." would pop up whilst the player was in contact with it. I also re organized my entire code which meant that I made 9 new files where I split up the classes from main.py. This meant that for ever class I made I had a separate file that I had to make, and then import them back into main so that It could work. Doing this took me a lesson or two because it was sometimes hard to figure out how and which files to import into main.py and window.py. I also noticed that as I was moving my classes around I got a better understanding of the different parts of my code. I also worked on my enemies and how they would function so I tested and trialed different things that would work. I wanted to make my game look good as well so I spent some time adding little details around my made world so that it would give it a more 3D look and be more appealing for my end users to play with
## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No team-mates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
I changed how my character idled, meaning that I implemented code that would make it so that when the character was stationary and not moving at all, an idle animation would play. I also got functioning enemies working which was a major achievement that I wanted to get done. 
## **Brief Description of your testing**
I tested the enemies speed and how they track the player as they move.

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
- Next time I want to improve on how I collect information
- I want to make sure that I am asking questions to people in my class to make sure that I am getting different view points of my game so that I can improve it and make it so that everyone would want to play it
- I also think that it would be good if I was able to get more inspiration of future art ideas so that my game can be more diverse and complicated
- I want to note all the code that I implement and the code that I already have so that I can make sure that I don't have any unnecessary pieces of code in my game that could be contradicting the code that I want
- I want to improve my testing and trialing and come up with new ways that I can improve my game

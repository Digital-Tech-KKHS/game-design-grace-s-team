# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I got a lot of code work done. I got speech pop ups to work so that when my character came into contact with a skull and bones, a speech message, "This looks dangerous...." would pop up whilst the player was in contact with it. I also re organized my entire code which meant that I made 9 new files where I split up the classes from main.py. This meant that for ever class I made I had a separate file that I had to make, and then import them back into main so that It could work. Doing this took me a lesson or two because it was sometimes hard to figure out how and which files to import into main.py and window.py. I also noticed that as I was moving my classes around I got a better understanding of the different parts of my code. I also worked on my enemies and how they would function so I tested and trialed different things that would work. I wanted to make my game look good as well so I spent some time adding little details around my made world so that it would give it a more 3D look and be more appealing for my end users to play with. From the beginning of making my game I have wanted my character be able to have the ability to idle when in a stationary mode. I ended up getting it to work however I ended up breaking my characters walking animation and cycle. I also ended up going through my maps and adding jumps as another way to increase the difficult.
## **Briefly describe other team members contributions**
- No team-mates
## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
I changed how my character idled, meaning that I implemented code that would make it so that when the character was stationary and not moving at all, an idle animation would play.
I also got functioning enemies working which was a major achievement that I wanted to get done. Having enemies meant that I had to decide how I wanted them to run and so I ended up having them be free moving which was exactly what my game was missing because it meant that my end users would have to watch out for running into something dangerous AND watch their backs for an enemy coming up behind them.
I also added an extra map so that I would have 3 instead of 2 so that I could tick that box in the marking process.
## **Brief Description of your testing**
I tested having a speed property of my enemies, so that I could change there speed in tiled when I need too.
I also tested having my enemies track my player and so that they could follow them no matter what, and so my player would have to avoid them

## **Notes for next time, future improvements**
- Next time I want to improve on how I collect information
- I want to make sure that I am asking questions to people in my class to make sure that I am getting different view points of my game so that I can improve it and make it so that everyone would want to play it
- I also think that it would be good if I was able to get more inspiration of future art ideas so that my game can be more diverse and complicated
- I want to note all the code that I implement and the code that I already have so that I can make sure that I don't have any unnecessary pieces of code in my game that could be contradicting the code that I want
- I want to improve my testing and trialing and come up with new ways that I can improve my game
- Because next sprint is the last sprint I want to get as much of my documentaion up to date as possible next sprint
- I want to add and make music for my game
- I need to make another map for my game that will include a winning function that will send the player to an end view
- I also want to fix my characters moving animation because it got wrecked when I was working on its idle animation
- Must make actual win, lose, and start screen art

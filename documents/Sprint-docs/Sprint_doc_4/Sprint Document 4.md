# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
In this sprint I got a lot of code work done. I got speech pop ups to work so that when my character came into contact with a skull and bones, a speech message, "This looks dangerous...." would pop up whilst the player was in contact with it. I also re organized my entire code which meant that I made 9 new files where I split up the classes from main.py. This meant that for ever class I made I had a separate file that I had to make, and then import them back into main so that It could work. Doing this took me a lesson or two because it was sometimes hard to figure out how and which files to import into main.py and window.py. I also noticed that as I was moving my classes around I got a better understanding of the different parts of my code

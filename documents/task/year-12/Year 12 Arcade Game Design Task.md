# Internal Assessment Resource

## Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko Level 2

This resource supports assessment against Achievement Standards 91893, 91896 and 91897

## Philosophy

“Make amazing things and the credits will take care of themselves.”

This assessment task and marking schedule is designed so that students don’t have to talk about what they are doing, or gather information about their planning. The concept is that if we make an amazing game, we will generate the evidence required. Every decision made in designing this task has this philosophy as it’s guiding principle.

At all times students doing amazing things is prioritised over students talking about what they did. The assessment task and marking schedules keep this in the forefront at all times.

# Resource title:   Arcade Game Development

## Introduction/Kupu Arataki

Your task is to create an amazing Arcade Game that you are very proud of. This should be of such a quality that you can use it for job interviews and as part of your portfolio of work.

You will be starting with a minimum viable game product that will be created together in class. You will then incrementally improving this game using three-week Sprint cycles of development. At the end of each sprint you will have a functioning game that is an improvement on the game from the last sprint.

During these sprint cycles, to ensure you create the best game you can you will need to test it and gather feedback from players.

## Timeframe

This is a project that runs for most of the year. It will be split into a number of Sprints to help manage the complexity of the project. It is anticipated that there will be 5 Sprints required to develop a high quality outcome.

## Task/Hei Mahi

Arcade Game Development. Arcade games have a rich history and are fun to make and play. Arcade games lead into careers within the rapidly growing game development industry. This year you will be creating a refined Arcade Game, designing all the assets, sounds, blocks and backdrops. You will be crafting and refining the game play, while adding features.

Starting with a minimum viable product, you will incrementally create and develop your game based on the results of user testing and feedback.

It is recommended that your game is an arcade platformer style of game. Other styles may be negotiated with your teacher.

You will be required to complete a Sprint Tracking document at the end of each Sprint. This document will capture your process.

You and your teacher will review each sprint to ensure that you are on track and to capture evidence required for the standards.

You will be required to capture your evolving list of features and ideas. This will change over time and will be captured in the sprint cycles. You will use a KANBAN board to capture this process.

Go and make something amazing!

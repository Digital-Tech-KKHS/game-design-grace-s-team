# Internal Assessment Resource

## Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko Level 2

This resource supports assessment against Achievement Standards 91893, 91896 and 91897

## Philosophy

“Make amazing things and the credits will take care of themselves.”

This assessment task and marking schedule is designed so that students don’t have to talk about what they are doing, or gather information about their planning. The concept is that if we make an amazing game, we will generate the evidence required. Every decision made in designing this task has this philosophy as it’s guiding principle.

At all times students doing amazing things is prioritised over students talking about what they did. The assessment task and marking schedules keep this in the forefront at all times.

# Resource title:   Arcade Game Development

Teachers/kaiako need to be very familiar with the outcome being assessed by the achievement standards. The achievement criteria and the explanatory notes contain information, definitions, and requirements that are crucial when interpreting the standard and assessing students/ākonga against it.


## Context/Te Horopaki

This is an integrated assessment activity supporting a project approach that assesses against three achievement standards.

This activity requires students to plan, design and manage the development of an arcade game computer program using complex programming and media techniques.

The aim of this assessment is for students to create an Arcade Game that they are very proud of and that showcases both their game design, character design and level design skills as well as their programming ability. A large project like this requires some form of project management. Students at all times are encouraged to get excited by the product and not to focus on the assessment criteria. Students who develop a refined arcade game, using user feedback and testing to refine it and project management techniques to manage the project will have the evidence required.

All the assessment requirements should fall out of the students creating an amazing Arcade Game.

The assessment task will be broken up into 10 two week long sprints. The program will be incrementally designed following a minimum viable product and incremental development. This allows the students to test the game and decide on the next things to add or how to refine the game at all stages through the game's development.

The format of the final outcome is an arcade game.

## Resource requirements/Ngā Rauemi

Students will need access to computers that have Python and the Arcade library installed. Pycharm is not required, however, it is strongly recommended as it helps to ensure PEP-8 guidelines are being followed. Students will need to be able to take screenshots and screencasts. Students will need to be able to record sounds, music as well as create backdrops, sprites and environmental assets for their games.

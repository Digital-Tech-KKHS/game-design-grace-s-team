# Internal Assessment Resource 
## Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko Level 3 - 

Updated 2023

This resource supports assessment against Achievement Standards 91903, 91906 and 91907 

### Philosophy

“Make amazing things and the credits will take care of themselves.”

This assessment task and marking schedule is designed so that students don’t have to talk about what they are doing, or gather information about their planning. The concept is that if we make an amazing game, we will generate the evidence required. Every decision made in designing this task has this philosophy as it’s guiding principle.

At all times students doing amazing things is prioritised over students talking about what they did. The assessment task and marking schedules keep this in the forefront at all times. Collaboration is a key focus of this project.

# Resource title: 	Arcade Game Studio
 
## Context/Te Horopaki
This activity requires a group of students to create a small game development studio, collectively plan, design and manage the development of an arcade game computer program using complex programming, media and design techniques.

The aim of this assessment is for students to collaboratively create an Arcade Game that they are very proud of and that showcases both their game design, character design and level design skills as well as their programming ability. A large collaborative project like this requires active project management and the assignment of different responsibilities within the studio. Students at all times are encouraged to get excited by the product and not to focus on the assessment criteria. Students who develop a refined arcade game, using user feedback and testing to refine it and project management techniques to manage the project will have the evidence required.

All the assessment requirements should fall out of the studio creating an amazing Arcade Game.

The assessment task will be broken up into 7 three week long sprints. The program will be incrementally designed following a minimum viable product and incremental development. This allows the students to test the game and decide on the next things to add or how to refine the game at all stages through the game's development.

The format of the final outcome is an arcade game. Students will be marked as a studio unless there is significant disparity of student contributions. This will be determined from sprint docs, student self assessment and through git blame.

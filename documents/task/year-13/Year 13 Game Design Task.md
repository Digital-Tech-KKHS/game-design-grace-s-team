# Resource title:   Arcade Game Development

## Introduction/Kupu Arataki

Your task is to form a small game development studio that creates an amazing Arcade Game that you are very proud of. This should be of such a quality that you can use it for job interviews and as part of your portfolio of work.

The Studio: In small groups of 2 - 3 you will be forming a small game development studio that will be collectively designing and developing the game. Each student will need to contribute to each aspect of development.

You will be starting with a Game Design Document that outlines the core aspects of the game including the overall narrative, art style, key gameplay components etc. and why your game should be developed.

Development will take place in 3 week sprint cycles. During these sprint cycles, to ensure you create the best game you can you will need to test it and gather feedback from players. At the end of the sprint you will meet as a studio and report back, teat each component you have developed through the sprint and teat your game on end users. 

## Timeframe

This is a project that runs for most of the year. It will be split into a number of Sprints to help manage the complexity of the project. It is anticipated that there will be 7 Sprints required to develop a high quality outcome.

Teacher note: Students negotiate due dates with their teacher that fall within the school year. This will be earlier if the students are choosing to be assessed against the external.

## Task/Hei Mahi

Arcade Game Development. Arcade games have a rich history and are fun to make and play. Arcade games lead into careers within the rapidly growing game development industry. This year you will be creating a refined Arcade Game, designing all the assets, sounds, blocks and backdrops. You will be crafting and refining the game play, while adding features.

Starting with a Game Design Document, you will incrementally create and develop your game based on the results of user testing and feedback.

It is recommended that your game is an arcade platformer style of game. Other styles may be negotiated with your teacher.

You will be required to complete a Sprint Tracking document at the end of each Sprint. This document will capture your process, and the progress of your studio.

You and your teacher will review each sprint to ensure that you are on track and to capture evidence required for the standards.

You will be required to capture your evolving list of features and ideas. This will change over time and will be captured in the sprint cycles. You will use a KANBAN board to capture this process.

Go and make something amazing!
